# Neural Networks for Project: Can AI Experience or Develop Schizophrenia?

This project explores whether AI can experience or develop schizophrenia by simulating neural activity patterns using basic neural network principles in Python. It features an interactive graphical interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to adjust parameters and observe behavior in real-time. 

## Features (subject to change)
- Simulates basic neuron-like responses.
- Interactive GUI using Tkinter.

## Technologies (subject to change)
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Tkinter.

## Future Plans
- Develop Python programs with a-typical, or scizophrenic neural behaviors.
- Enhance the GUI with better visualization tools.
- Expand to explore deeper capabilities in AI
